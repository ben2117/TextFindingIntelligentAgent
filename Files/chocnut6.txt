1. Preheat oven to 180C/160C fan forced. Grease six 85ml (3/4 cup) dariole moulds or Texas muffin pans and line the bases with baking paper.
2. Combine chocolate, butter, water and cocoa in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until mixture is melted and smooth. Remove from heat. Add hazelnut meal, sugar, liqueur, five spice and egg yolks. Stir to combine.
3. Use electric beaters to beat egg whites in a clean, dry bowl until soft peaks form. Add half the egg white to the chocolate mixture. Stir to combine. Gently fold in remaining egg white until just combined. Spoon mixture among prepared moulds. Place on a baking tray. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until cooked when tested with a skewer. Set aside for 5 minutes to cool slightly. Turn onto a wire rack to cool.
4. Meanwhile, for the sauce, combine the Nutella, thickened cream and chocolate in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth.
5. Place cakes on serving plates and drizzle with the warm chocolate hazelnut sauce. Serve with a dollop of double cream.
