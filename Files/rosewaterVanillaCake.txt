Rosewater and Vanilla Cake

1. Preheat oven to 180C/160C fan-forced. Grease a 22cm (top) baba pan.
2. Using an electric mixer, beat butter, sugar, vanilla and rosewater for 5 minutes or until light and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating until combined after each addition. Stir in flour and milk, in 2 batches, until combined. Spoon mixture into prepared pan. Level the top with a spatula.
3. Bake for 1 hour or until a skewer inserted in centre of cake comes out clean (cover cake loosely with foil if overbrowning during cooking). Stand cake in pan for 5 minutes. Turn cake out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
4. Make Rose icing: Sift icing sugar into a bowl. Whisk in rosewater and lemon juice. Add 1 tablespoon cold water. Whisk until mixture is smooth, adding some extra cold water, if necessary.
5. Place the cooled cake on a cake stand or serving plate. Spoon icing over the top of the cake, allowing icing to drizzle down sides. Set aside to allow icing to set. Serve.
