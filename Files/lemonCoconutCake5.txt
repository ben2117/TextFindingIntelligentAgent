Lemon and Coconut Cake

1. Preheat oven to 170C or 150C fan and line 12 medium muffin tins with paper cases. Place flour into a large mixing bowl. Stir in coconut and sugar and make a well in the centre.
2. Use a fork to whisk eggs, coconut milk and lemon zest in a jug. Add to the dry ingredients, along with the butter. Fold together until just combined but don't mix or beat. Spoon into prepared cases. Bake for 20 mins, or until springy to a light touch. Leave in the tin for 5 mins then lift out onto a wire rack to cool.
3. To make the icing, sift icing sugar into a bowl and add butter. Pour boiling water onto butter to melt it and stir until smooth. Spread over each cake, sprinkle with coconut flakes and leave to set.
