Lemon Coconut Cake

1. Preheat the oven to 180C. Grease a 10cm x 22cm loaf pan and line with baking paper, allowing the 2 long sides to overhang.
2. Use an electric mixer to beat the butter and sugar in a bowl until pale and creamy. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the sour cream and stir to combine. Stir in the combined flour and coconut. Add the lemon rind, lemon juice and coconut essence and stir to combine. Spoon into the prepared pan and smooth the surface. Bake for 1 hour or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Set aside for 10 mins. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
3. To make the lemon icing, sift the icing sugar into a small bowl. Stir in enough lemon juice to make a runny paste. Spoon the icing over the top of the cake. Sprinkle with lemon zest. Set aside to set. Cut into slices.
