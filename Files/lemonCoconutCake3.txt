lemon Coconut Cake

1. Preheat oven to 170°C. Grease an 11 x 21cm (base measurement) loaf pan with melted butter. Line the base with non-stick baking paper.
2. Use an electric beater to beat the butter, sugar and lemon rind until pale and creamy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
3. Stir the desiccated coconut into the egg mixture. Fold in the flour, lemon juice and milk, in alternating batches, until just combined. Spoon mixture into the prepared pan and smooth the surface.
4. Bake cake in oven for 1 hour or until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean. Set aside in pan for 5 minutes before turning onto a wire rack to cool completely.
5. Combine the icing sugar, water and vanilla in a bowl. Drizzle over the cake and sprinkle with flaked coconut. Serve.
