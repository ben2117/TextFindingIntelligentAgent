Plum and Blueberry Poppy Seed Cake

1. Preheat oven to 190C/170C fan-forced. Lightly grease a 6cm-deep, 20cm-round cake pan. Line base with baking paper.
2. Place 2 tablespoons butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on HIGH (100%) for 30 seconds or until melted. Pour into pan. Swirl to coat paper. Sprinkle 1/2 cup brown sugar evenly over butter. Arrange plum evenly over base of pan. Sprinkle with blueberries, filling in any gaps.
3. Using an electric mixer, beat remaining butter and remaining sugar on high for 3 minutes or until light and fluffy. Beat in egg, egg white and orange rind until combined. Whisk flour, poppy seeds, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt in a medium bowl.
4. Add flour mixture to butter mixture. Beat on low speed until combined. Beat in buttermilk and vanilla until smooth. Spoon batter into prepared pan. Tap pan firmly on bench several times to remove air bubbles. Smooth top. Bake for 45 minutes or until cake is golden brown and a skewer inserted in centre comes out clean.
5. Cool cake in pan on a wire rack for 1 hour. Gently run a knife around edge of pan and invert cake onto a serving plate. Serve warm or at room temperature.
