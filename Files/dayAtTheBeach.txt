Swimming in the ocean. 

The deep water is cold and refreshing. Salt in my eyes. Blinded by the sun. Surrounded by plants and animals.Was it seaweed that touched me? Was it a fish? Who knows. As the wind picks up, I make myself back to the shore. The sand on the beach is still warm. What a nice day out.
