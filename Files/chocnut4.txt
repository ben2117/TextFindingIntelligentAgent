1. Preheat oven to 200°C. Line a 12 cup muffin pan with paper cases.
2. Combine flours, ground hazelnuts, cocoa, brown sugar, baking powder and soda in a bowl.
3. Whisk buttermilk, oil, egg whites and chocolate spread together until smooth. Pour into dry ingredients and mix together quickly using a wooden spoon until just combined. Mixture may be lumpy and does not have to be evenly mixed.
4. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the mixture into the base of each paper case. Top with 1/2 teaspoon of the extra chocolate spread. Divide remaining mixture evenly between cases. Bake for about 20 minutes or until cooked through. Cool for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
