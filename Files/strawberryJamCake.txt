1. Make cheat's strawberry jam: Combine strawberries, sugar and lemon juice in a small saucepan. Set aside for 5 minutes. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes or until sugar has dissolved. Bring to the boil. Reduce heat to low. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or until slightly thickened. Combine cornflour and 1 teaspoon cold water in a bowl. Add to strawberry mixture, stirring constantly. Simmer for 1 to 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from heat. Cool.
2. Preheat oven to 180°C/160°C fan-forced. Grease two 6cm-deep, 20cm (base) round cake pans. Line bases with baking paper.
3. Using an electric mixer, beat eggs, sugar and vanilla for 8 to 10 minutes or until thick and creamy and sugar has dissolved.
4. Sift flours together 3 times (see note). Using a whisk, fold flour into egg mixture (see Cooking class, below). Fold in boiling water. Divide mixture between prepared pans. Bake for 25 minutes or until sponges spring back when lightly touched. Line 2 wire racks with baking paper. Stand sponges in pans for 2 minutes. Turn, top-side up, onto wire racks to cool.
5. Place 1 sponge on a plate. Top with jam and cream. Top with remaining sponge. Dust with icing sugar. Serve.
