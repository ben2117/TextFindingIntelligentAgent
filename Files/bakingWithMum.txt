Baking with mum

Mum said we would make a lemon and coconut cake today. It was very exciting. I opened our cupboard full of groceries to see which ingredients we already have and which ones we need to buy from the shop. I used the recipe and ticked the things we already have off. At the end, I wrote the unticked ones down on a piece of paper. Then mum and I went to the store and bought them. When we got home, we made the cake. It smelled delicious and tasted even better! I told mum I love baking with her and we decided to bake together more often.
