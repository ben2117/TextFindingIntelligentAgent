1. 
Preheat oven to 200°C. Lightly grease 9 x 1/2 cup (125ml) oval friand pans with butter. Melt unsalted butter in a saucepan over a medium heat until golden. Set aside.
2. Sift plain flour, cocoa powder and icing sugar mixture into a bowl. Fold in hazelnut meal. Add egg whites, with a fork and the butter.
3. Spoon the mixture into the friand pans and bake for 5 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 180°C and bake for a further 15 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before turning onto a wire rack to cool completely. Ice the friands with frosting or icing of your choice and decorate with speckled Easter eggs.
