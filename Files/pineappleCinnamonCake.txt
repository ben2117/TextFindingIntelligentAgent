pineapple and cinnamon cake

1. Preheat oven to 180C. Grease a 20cm square cake pan and line the base and sides with baking paper.
2. Use an electric mixer to beat the softened butter, caster sugar and vanilla until pale and creamy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Sift combined flour over the egg mixture. Fold until just combined. Add milk. Fold until just combined. Spoon into the prepared pan and smooth the surface. Arrange pineapple, slightly overlapping, on top of batter. Brush with melted butter. Combine cinnamon and white sugar and sprinkle over the top.
3. Bake for 50 mins or until a skewer inserted in centre comes out clean. Stand in pan for 10 mins. Transfer, top-side up, onto a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature with cream.
