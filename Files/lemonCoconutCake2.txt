Coconut lemon Cake

1. Preheat oven to 180°C. Grease and line the base and sides of a 19 x 29cm slice pan with baking paper, allowing the long sides to overhang.
2. Use an electric mixer to beat the butter and sugar until combined. Add the egg and beat until just combined. Add the flour and coconut and stir with a wooden spoon until combined. Spoon mixture into the prepared pan and smooth the surface with the back of a spoon. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes or until golden.
3. Meanwhile, to make the lemon curd, combine the butter, sugar, egg, lemon rind and juice in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until mixture boils and thickens. Remove from heat and set aside to cool slightly.
4. Spread the lemon curd evenly over the prepared base. To make the coconut topping, use a fork to whisk the eggs and sugar in a medium bowl. Add the shredded and desiccated coconut and stir until well combined. Sprinkle evenly over the lemon curd. Bake in oven for 20-25 minutes or until the coconut is lightly golden and set. Set aside in pan to cool completely. Cut into squares to serve.
