Snorkelling with Reef Sharks

Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia offers excellent opportunities for snorkelling with reef sharks. The majestic animals of 2 to 3 meters are amazing to look at - although meeting them under water might make your heart skip a beat. A few things to keep in mind: it is important not to panic. Don't splash, don't make hectic movements. Keep your calm and slowly continue your way away from the animals. They will not see humans as prey - putting up a fight against us would cost too much energy. You will however be attacked if you are seen as a threat. Remember not to get too close. Watch from a distance and enjoy the beauty of the majestic predetors.
