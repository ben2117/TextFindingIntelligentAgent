1. Preheat oven to 160C. Grease and line a square 23cm cake pan.
2. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, cream butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in zest.
3. Fold flour and poppy seeds into creamed mixture, alternately with combined juice and milk, until combined. Spoon mixture into prepared pan. Bake for 50-55 mins, until cooked when tested with a skewer.
4. To make the orange syrup, when the cake is almost cooked, combine all ingredients in a small saucepan. Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves. Bring to boil and simmer for 5-8 mins, until syrupy.
5. Remove cake from pan and place on a wire rack over a shallow tray. Pierce cake all over top with a skewer. Pour half of the hot syrup gradually over hot cake. Cool to room temperature. Serve drizzled with reserved syrup and thick cream.
