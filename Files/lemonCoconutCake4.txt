Coconut and Lemon Cake

1. Preheat oven to 180°C. Grease six 1/2 cup (125ml) capacity mini loaf pans and place on an oven tray.
2. Use an electric mixer to beat butter, sugar and lemon rind until pale and creamy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition until just combined. Stir in the flours, coconut, coconut powder and lemon juice until just combined. Spoon among prepared pans and use a palette knife to smooth the surface.
3. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes or until a skewer inserted into cakes comes out clean. Turn on to a wire rack to cool.
4. To make the icing: sift icing sugar into a small bowl. Gradually add lemon juice until a smooth paste forms. Spread icing over the top of each cake. Set aside until firm.
5. Top cakes with candied lemon to serve.
