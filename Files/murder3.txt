A Real Basket Case

Claire gripped the toilet bowl with white-knuckled hands. Her stomach heaved again. This time nothing came up. Laying her cheek against the hard porcelain rim, she let the comforting cold seep into her skin. She waited then wiped her mouth with a tissue. She scrubbed at the rust-colored stains around the rim—bloody fingerprints.

My fingerprints. Enrique’s blood. Oh, God.

All her wiping managed to do was smear the stains. She stared at the damning evidence. Enrique was dead because of her.

Tears threatened again. She squeezed her eyes shut, willed the tears away, and took a deep breath. She balled up the tissue, threw it in the toilet, and flushed. After pushing herself to her feet, she leaned against the wall to clear her head and settle her lurching stomach.

Her robe gaped open, exposing her bloodstained thighs, the sticky streaks cracking where they had dried. She yanked her robe shut and cinched the belt tight. She felt an overwhelming urge to shower, to stand under burning hot water and scrub and scrub and scrub until her skin was raw. But no amount of scrubbing could wash away the guilt.

And the police detective was waiting.
